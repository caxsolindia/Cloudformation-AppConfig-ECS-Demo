# CloudFormation-Based Setup of AWS AppConfig and ECS Integration for Application Configuration Management

The provided YAML code is a CloudFormation script that sets up AWS AppConfig and integrates it with ECS (Elastic Container Service). It consists of four sections, each defining a CloudFormation stack for different components of the setup:

1. vpc.yml: This script sets up the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) resources such as VPC, subnets, internet gateway, and route tables.

2. appconfig.yml: This script sets up the AWS AppConfig resources, including the application, environment, configuration profile, and IAM role with S3 access permissions.

3. ecs.yml: This script sets up ECS resources, including the ECS cluster, task definition, and service. It also configures environment variables for the ECS task to pass values from AWS AppConfig.

4. deployment.yml: This script sets up a deployment strategy and creates a deployment for the AWS AppConfig resources.

To use this CloudFormation script, you can create a new CloudFormation stack and provide the YAML code as the template. The stack will deploy the necessary resources and set up the integration between AWS AppConfig and ECS.

## Note: The YAML code provided assumes that you have already created the required S3 bucket containing the referenced templates (vpc.yml, appconfig.yml, and ecs.yml) and the necessary AMI (Amazon Machine Image) for the ECS task execution role. Ensure that you modify the template URLs and other parameters as per your environment and configurations.
